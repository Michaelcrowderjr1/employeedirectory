## Usage 
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees will render. The user will be able to:
* Sort the table by at least one category
* Filter the users by at least one property.
